			<p>Overall the project was fun but demanding at the same time since the purpose of designing the website, creativity, had to be repeatedly applied to gain further developments.  Members of the group described this whole project as a whole design process, in other words they meant as one step was taken, many steps emerged and further problems arose. Steps led to steps like a domino effect. We knew this experience was a good set of practice not only for future projects but for our design skills.
			<br />
			<br />
			<strong>What we learnt about designing a website?</strong>
			<br />
			<br />
			We achieved our final prototype by learning design techniques through our design process. Most of the times each of our group members had to reflect on their practices learnt from the past practical classes and apply new concepts and techniques to the design of our website. 
			<br />
			<br />			
			<strong>What were the design-processed techniques that contributed to the design?</strong>
			<br />
			<br />
			In the beginning we visited many sites and understood what the trends of content inventories were and how they were formed. Organisation was the underlying technique which helped generated the content and hence the basic structure of our website.  Secondly, the card sorting of the content improved the structure and raised more ideas that could be used in the next design step. An initial paper prototype was then constructed to give a more detailed picture of how the website was going to actually look and function. The paper prototype was not the best trial model to conduct on users but it was enough to draw improvements in our design process. This thoroughly outlined the test scenarios our group then made for design justifications. Lastly we summarised all the evaluations of our design process and developed a final website. Being very exact and clear with the steps of development and knowing how to work around with creativity was what we believed the very key to this project was.
			Although the website and creativity of the architecture of the website was not the best due to the time consumption of the design process and other assignments we benefited with a good practice in website design.
