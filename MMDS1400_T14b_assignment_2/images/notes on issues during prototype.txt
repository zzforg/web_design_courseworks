when the sidebar was highlighted over, lists of pages appeared. However the user had some confusion about the sidebars itself. Each of the categories in the sidebar displays an overview of the list when clicekd on.  The user did not agree with having to click on the categories to show a seperate overview page (summarises the list) knowing that the a list appears everytime u highlight over the categories. The user suggested instead of clicking on the categories one by one, have the overview page to appear once highlighted over the category. THis means once the category is highlighted, a list will show up ofcourse and also the overview of the category/list. eg. Once food is highlighted, a page will appear while the list of foods appears from the sidebar.
