			<p><strong>Assignment Goal:</strong>Develop and tests our understanding of the methodology of user-centered development and master our skills in applying these concepts and techniques to the design of our website.</p>
			<p><strong>Introdution of the proposed website:</strong>
			<br />
			At the start of the project our group came up with a website theme based on travelling to a region. We finally decided our region would be Hong Kong, and we came up with the website name being <em><strong>"Travelling in Hong Kong"</strong></em>. For this website we aimed to inform our targeted website users about a travel experience and guide in Hong Kong. Mainly our website is going to offer background information on travelling in Hong Kong, specifically the cuisine, attractions, destinations, accommodations and news in Hong Kong. Our second goal is to assist interested users to easily acknowledge their desired information about travelling in Hong Kong from our website.
